## ABSTRACT:
The objective of this project is  to built a web App that automatically estimates food attributes such as ingredients and nutritional value by classifying the input 
image of food. Clarifai's AI-Driven Food Detection Model Service is used to analyze the food image which given by the user as a input and Nutrition API is used to provide nutritional information about the analyzed user image.



## PROJECT OBJECTIVES:

Food is the key element of every human body. So, diet must be always taken into consideration. The knowledge about total intake of calories and nutrients to be consumed to maintain a fit and healthy life is needed. But, in most of the cases, unfortunately people face difficulties during estimation and measurement of the amount of food intake due to the mainly lack of nutritional information.Now-a-days obesity in adults is increasing at a shocking rate. The primary source of obesity is the disparity between the amount of meal intake and the energy burnt through physical activity. Colon, breast, and prostate cancers are caused due to high calorie intake. 
This application will be more flexible and any user can access at anytime.User can upload any food images and the API gives nutritional information for maintaining healthy lifestyle. Users can get in touch with the dietician through our portal for more information.
